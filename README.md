NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data
Project Overview
In the era of increasing dietary awareness, accurately classifying food items based on nutritional attributes is highly valuable.
NutriClass is a machine learning project that classifies food into multiple categories using tabular nutritional data such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, sugar, and more.
The project builds and compares multiple traditional machine learning models to identify the best-performing and most interpretable approach for food classification.
Skills Gained
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Feature Engineering
•	Multi-class Classification
•	Model Evaluation & Comparison
